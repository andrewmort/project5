Initial etr input: input/tiny.etr
Mapped using: input/tiny.p5map

6 vectors in file
1 clock signals present
1 control signals present
2 total input signals present (with controls & scanins, not including clocks)
1 total output signals preset (including scanouts)
3 internal scan flip flops
0 boundary scan cells
1 scan chains present


** Ordering of signals corresponds to order of bits in test vectors **

CLOCKS: CK
CONTROLS: scan_en

SCAN_INS: SI_scan
SCAN_OUTS: SO_scan

**SCAN_CHAIN scan: SI_scan >> out[0], out[1], out[2] >> SO_scan

** User must define change values on control signal vectors
** Inputs must have value '0', '1', or 'Z'
** Outputs must have value 'L', 'H', or 'X'
